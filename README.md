Instruction:
There will be a while loop for a menu that gives you 5 option to choose from.

Function 1: Enter a integer to see if it exist in the array or not.

Function 2: Enter a VALID index within that you want to modify or it will throw a out of range error. Inputting a string will also throw a runtime error. 
            Then enter a valid new Value. Entering a string will throw a runtime error. 

Function 3: Enter a valid integer that you want to add to end of list. Only works if if doesn't go past the maximum size of array or else it will throw a out of range error. 
            Inputting a string will also throw a runtime error. 
            
Function 4: Enter a valid index that is within the array that you want to modify. You will get 2 options after this:
            Enter 1 to replace value with 0 OR Enter 0 to remove integer all together.

Pressing Q in the menu option will quit the program.
